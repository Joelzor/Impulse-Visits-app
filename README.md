## Impulse Visits

Impulse Visits is my personal project for the end of the Boolean frontend module. It is essentially a smaller Tripadvisor application, allowing users to search for a location and recieve information about places they can visit within a certain distance. See the below for which features will be added down the line!

### MVP

The user can see their location on the screen- if incorrect, they can search for a city; they will then get a list of activities near their location; the user can filter this list by activity type; they will also see a map of the city

### V2

A ‘plan to do’ page will alllow the user to add an activity to a list where they can view them all together- this will be preserved for future visits

### V3

The user will be able to click on an activity which will redirect them to a separate activity page with further information

### V4

The map is populated by pins showing where each activity is

## Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Future updates

- Responsive design
- Bug fixes
- In terms of the code itself, I probably won't refactor much- this was my first ever front-end project (outside of tutorials) so I want to keep the code as is for legacy purposes :D

## Version 2

I plan to recreate this app from scratch using a different API- as you can see in the live version, the API I used has quite a few limitations. I also want to plan it better and deliver a less bugged and more streamlined web application. I am still proud of the original one, however, for the reasons stated above!
