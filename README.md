## Impulse Visits

Impulse Visits is my personal project for the end of the Boolean frontend module. It is essentially a smaller Tripadvisor application, allowing users to search for a location and recieve information about places they can visit within a certain distance. See the below for which features will be added down the line!

Stack: React, Tailwind CSS

### MVP 

The user can see their location on the screen- if incorrect, they can search for a city; they will then get a list of activities near their location; the user can filter this list by activity type; they will also see a map of the city

### V2

A ‘plan to do’ page will alllow the user to add an activity to a list where they can view them all together- this will be preserved for future visits

### V3

The user will be able to click on an activity which will redirect them to a separate activity page with further information

### V4 

The map is populated by pins showing where each activity is

### V5

The user will be able to post reviews of activities/ places they’ve been to
